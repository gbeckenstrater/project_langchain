      "ABSTRACT: The RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg bodyweight, however this may not be sufficient for athletes looking to maximize skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle mass. The amount of protein source required to maximize MPS is likely dependent upon its leucine content. Leucine is responsible for most of the anabolic effects of a meal and current research suggests that 3g (~0.05g/kg bodyweight) of leucine is required to maximize this response. The MPS response to a mixed meal is only 3 hours long despite producing elevations in amino acids for 5 hours, thus athletes maximizing MPS will require inducing this response multiple times throughout the day. Consuming multiple meals per day containing 3g of leucine may be beneficial in maximizing MPS. \n",
